    <h2>Description</h2>
    <i>Ingredients</i>
    <ul type="square">
    <li>Butter 100 g</li>
    <li>Sugar 50 g</li>
    <li>Sour cream 20% 2 tbsp.</li>
    <li>Sour cream 20% 2 tbsp.</li>
    <li>Wheat flour 1.5 tbsp.</li>
    <li>Baking powder 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>

    <i>Steps</i>
    <ol type= "I">
    <li>We clean the apples from the cores, leave the peel as desired.  Cut apples into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan, you can replace it with butter.  Cover with a lid, make a small fire and simmer the apples until soft.  Cooking time depends on the variety of apples.  Summer and autumn varieties are cooked faster, 5-8 minutes, winter varieties - 10-15 minutes.  The apples should be soft, but not mushy.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and add sugar to the prepared apples, mix.</li>
    <li>Beat butter with sugar, then add sour cream and mix again.</li>
    <li>We sift the flour.  Knead the dough with the addition of baking powder and flour.</li>
    <li>We do not knead for a long time, you need to remember that shortbread dough does not like hands.  You should get a soft dough.</li>
    <li>We cover the baking dish with parchment, the diameter of my form is 20 cm. If the form is non-separable, I make two strips under the parchment, as in the photo, in order to make it easier to get the cake after baking.</li>
    <li>Turn on the oven so that it warms up to 180ºС.  Cut off a third of the dough for the lattice, while we put it aside.  We roll out most of it, transfer it to the mold and form the sides according to the height of the mold.</li>
    <li>Putting the filling on the dough.</li>
    <li>Roll out the remaining dough into a layer 0.5 cm thick. Use a knife or a wheel for pasties to cut strips 1 cm wide. Lay the strips on the filling in the form of a lattice.  We pass along the edges of the form with the cloves of a fork so that the edges of the dough are fastened with a lattice.</li>
    <li>Bake the cake with apples until golden brown for 35-40 minutes, focus on your oven.</li>
    <li>Serve the cake to the table warm or completely COOL.  Happy tea!</li>
